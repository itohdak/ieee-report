\section{Introduction}
Although there are many researches on the field of Programming by Demonstration (PbD)~\cite{PbD_bimanual_assembly}\cite{PbD_HMM}, the usability through the learning process have not been focused on. We considered that the easiest way to teach the robot new motions is by the human demonstration through the aural communication, for not using other devices and being hands-free, and above all being intuitive. We built an original aural communication based PbD framework and tested our framework with a real robot HRP-2.
