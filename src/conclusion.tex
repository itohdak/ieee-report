\section{Conclusions}

We have constructed the system to learn motions with stochastic models and reproduce them from the learned model.

For the future work, we come back to human-robot cooperation tasks, which the human and the robot needs to work synchronously. Now, the robot can acquire the motion in probablistic manner with the system in this paper. The robot can also reproduce each motion from the stochastically learned model information. Here, it is the timing that has to be considered to accomplish the synchronous tasks; when to start and finish the motion.
