\section{Conclusions}
In this research, we proposed a framework that the human can teach the robot a new motion intuitively. To make the process user-friendly, we took advantage of aural communication through the process. In order for the robot to reproduce the human demonstrated motion, we extended the idea of the potential field and make it available with other moving target points. Using aural communication also worked in favor for indicating a certain motion and connecting each motion with its motivating condition. We confirmed that our framework worked with the real robot in the experiment.
