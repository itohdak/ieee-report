\section{RELATED WORKS}
There are many studies on cooperative works not only between a human and a robot, but also between two robots. In this section, we give examples of those related works working on cooperative interaction and describe the limitations on each research.\par
%% There are some research on cooperative works by two robots~\cite{robot-robot1}\cite{robot-robot2}. These researchs are efficient if we consider some situations where the objective tasks have fixed orders beforehand. However, under the household situations, they might not. In order to execute varied tasks, we have to prepare the robots' motion for each task by programming. It is not suitable for a daily enviroment including several tasks in several orders.
%% In this research, we consider human-robot cooperation tasks and structed a leader-follower system so that giving aural instructions to the robot, various tasks can be executed. Since the robot gets its motion by imitating human motion, another programmed motion have not to be prepared for new tasks.

From the point of view of human-robot cooperative works, 
%% There are several cooperative types between a human and a robot.
