\section{Introduction}

In this research, we have been focusing on how the robot can learn its motor skills for what we are doing in everyday life by observing human demonstrations. Previously, we have developed two frameworks; one is to execute human-robot cooperative tasks and the other is to store the motion information, which is mainly the trajectory of the hands. These frameworks made reproduction of the motions available. In both systems, in order to acquire the motion trajectories for imitatation or remembering, the robot observes human demonstrations. However, these pure imitations had some limitations in terms of speed and generalization. The memory also reaches the capacity limit if the robot continues to store the whole trajectory data in each task. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we will introduce a generalizing method considering a stochastic approach.
